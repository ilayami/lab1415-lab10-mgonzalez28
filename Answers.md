# Q&A
1) Discuss the differences among the results.
  - Randonwalk revisits some states multiple times given different starting points
  - Closest first produces a completely random output with different starting points
  - Depth first produces an output in which some of the states are in the same order given two different starting points
  - Breadth first seems to act the same as closest first, producing a random output from two different starting points
2) Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
  - Maps may require more than four colors if...
    - more than one country has multiple disconnected regions (from Four Color Theorem)
    - a map uses regions of finite area but infinite perimeter  (from Four Color Theorem)
